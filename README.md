# Car Park Analysis Project (Python)

This project demonstrates Python skills for working with real-world data, including reading files, analyzing data, and writing outputs. 
It was created as part of my studies while learning data analysis and programming.

## Features

1. **Car Data Import and Processing**  
- Reads car data from a file (`car_park.txt`) and organizes it into a list of dictionaries.  
- Each dictionary represents a car with details like license number, manufacturer, model, and year.

2. **Analysis Functions**
- Identifies manufacturers with multiple cars in the dataset.  
- Allows users to search for all cars by a specific manufacturer.  
- Finds and exports details of cars older than 10 years to a CSV file.

3. **Interactive User Experience**
- Provides console-based prompts for selecting manufacturers.  
- Outputs results to both the console and external files for easy access.

4. **File Outputs**  
- Saves car details by the selected manufacturer to `Cars.txt`.  
- Exports cars older than 10 years to `Old_Cars.csv`.

## Files in the Repository

- **`car_park.txt`**: Input file containing car data.
- **`Old_Cars.csv`**: Output file with data on cars older than 10 years.
- **`Cars.txt`**: Output file with data filtered by manufacturer.
- **Script File**: Python script implementing all functionalities.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-park-analysis.git
    cd car-park-analysis
    ```
    
2. Ensure the **`car_park.txt`** file is present in the project directory

3. Run the script:
   
    ```bash
    python car_park_analysis.py
    ```
    
4. Follow the prompts to interact with the program.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data manipulation using Python.
- File I/O operations (reading, writing, CSV handling).
- Basic use of control structures and functions for real-world tasks.

## Why This Project?

This project showcases my ability to work with data files, process and analyze information, and create user-friendly outputs. 
It reflects the analytical and programming skills I am developing to excel as a data analyst.
